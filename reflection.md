- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    Encapsulation helps classes work together by using methods from other classes (like the Train class being able to use methods from the other classes). This helps us organize our code in different files and classes and still be able to have those files and classes work together, which can be helpful in larger projects.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Something new I came across was that I kept getting variables marked with the problem message "field can be final". In Java projects before this class (not at Smith) I tended to avoid marking variables as final even if they did not need to be changed later on in the code, but for the sake of resolving the problem messages I marked the necessary variables as final.
    Also, initially the manifest printed the class name and hash code for each passenger. In previous projects I have needed to override toString() in order to return the string instead, so i added that to the Passenger class.
